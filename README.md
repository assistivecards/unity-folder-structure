The structure we should use in all the games;

* Editor
* Animations
* Packages (imported packages independent of unity's package manager)
* Models
* Prefabs
* Scenes
* ScriptableObjects
* Scripts
* Settings (setting profiles)
* Shaders
* Sprites
*  -> UI
*  -> Game
* Test (things to test things, will be deleted)
